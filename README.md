# PassGen
Small password generator written in python.
Doesn't save your passwords. If you think I should add the ability to, please convey that to me.  

# Usage
Pretty simple to use, run the main.py and go to town!
The program will ask for the desired length of your new password and generate one promptly.

    python3 main.py

# Changing the charset
You can easily change the character set used by the script by
changing the characters in the 'c' variable on line 3.

    c="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+-="
or

    c="0123456789"
